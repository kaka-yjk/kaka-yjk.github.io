## Welcome to My Homepage

I am a first-year Master's student with a passion for Multimodal Machine Learning. I am enthusiastic about exploring how information from different modalities can be fused to enhance machine understanding, particularly in areas like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and Large Multimodal Models.

I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position in related research fields. If you are looking for motivated Ph.D. students, please feel free to contact me.
